* How to unrole a Turing Machine computation to a boolean circuit?
a TM
can be “unrolled” into a Boolean circuit that is not much larger than
the number of steps in the computation. (This result is similar to
the famous Cook-Levin theorem; see, for instance, the Arora-Barak
text [2, Thm 6.6, Thm 6.18].)
