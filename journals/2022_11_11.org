#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For all points of the transition quotient codeword that were queried in the first round of FRI do:
+ Let the point be \((x, y)\) .
+ Query the matching points on the boundary quotient codewords. Note that there are two of them, \( x \) and \(\omicron x\), indicating points "one cycle apart".
+ Multiply the y-coordinates of these points by the zerofiers' values in \( x \) and \(\omicron x\).
+ Add the boundary interpolants' values.
+ Evaluate the master transition constraint in this point.
+ Divide by the value of the transition zerofier in \(x\).
+ Verify that the resulting value equals \(y\).
