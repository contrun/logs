* A mathematical theory of collaborative filtering? Collaborative filtering is a machine learning method that is used to recommend related items to users. Users have preferences over latent factors and items have properties of latent factors. Each users can be represented as a vector of weights of latent factors, while each item can be represented as a vector of weights of the dual of latent factors. The dot product can be viewed as user's preferences over that item. The norm of the user and item can be viewed as the intrinsic value of the user or item. The collaborative filtering process is th find out similar users and thus find out items some user may like. [[collaborative filtering]]
