But, there is no practical trapdoorless (strong) accumulator that can produce constant-size proofs. In trapdoorless accumulators, since the accumulator manager is also considered untrusted, the witness size grows at least like log(N) where N is the number of accumulated elements (Ghosh et al., 2016).
