* Can the range proof of a large range (say \( [0, 2^{128}) \)) too large to be constructed from lookup arguments? What to do then if we really want to construct range proofs from lookup arguments?
Under the hood, lookup arguments use permutation arguments. The maximum cardinality of the set We can decompose a number \( n \in [0, 2^{128}) \) to \( n_1*2^{64 }+ n_2 \), and prove both \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are in the range \( [0, 2^{64}) \).
