* In p53 (section A Useful Subroutine: Reducing Multiple Polynomial Evaluations to One), the author state that the verification of the evaluation of \( \tilde{W} \) at two points \( b, c \) can be reduced to a claim about \( r \), where \( r \) is chosen randomly by the verifier. The final step is to verify the equality of \( \tilde{W}(r) \) and \( q(t) \) where \( l(t) = r \) and \( l(0) = b, l(1) =c \). The question is that how does the verifier evaluate \( \tilde{W}(r) \)? If the verifier can do such thing, why does not it evaluate  [[Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge]]
