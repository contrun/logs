* In p53 (section A Useful Subroutine: Reducing Multiple Polynomial Evaluations to One), the author state that the verification of the evaluation of \( \tilde{W} \) at two points \( b, c \) can be reduced to a claim about \( r \), where \( r \) is chosen randomly by the verifier. The final step is to verify the equality of \( \tilde{W}(r) \) and \( q(t) \) where \( l(t) = r \), \( l(0) = b\) and \( l(1) =c \). The question is that how does the verifier evaluate \( \tilde{W}(r) \)? This must be done by the verifier, otherwise the prover can just send \( q(t) \). If the verifier can do such thing, why does not it evaluate \( \tilde{W}(b) \) and \( \tilde{W}(c) \) directly? [[Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge]]
