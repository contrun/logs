* Any universal rule to test randomness? There are many ways to test if a bit string is generated randomly. For example, a randomly generated bit string should have roughly the same number of 0s and 1s. This test can be generalized to bit strings of any length. Another generalization is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test][Chi-squared test - Wikipedia]]. These tests can rule out some non-random bit strings, but not all of them. Are there any other rules to the
