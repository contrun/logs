* Let \( v \) be a vector, denote right shift \( v \) by n by \( v^{^\rightarrow  n} \). What is the relationship between the polynomial commitment of \( v \) and \( v^{^\rightarrow  n} \)? Give relationship for both schemes in ((6342705c-75ea-449a-8f7b-8076492c1724)). What about left shift?
* Let \( \sigma: [n] \to [n] \) be a permutation of the set \( [n] := {i \in \Z: 0\le i < n} \). Assume \( \omega \) is a generator of a order \(n\) multiplicative subgroup of a finite field. Let \(f\) (respective \(g\)) be the polynomial satisfies \( f(\omega^i) = x_i \) (respectively \( g(\omega^i) = x_{\omega(i)} \)) for some \( x_i \) in the finite field. What's the relationship between \(f\) and \(g\)?
