* Why is [[https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.14][Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity]] called Reed-Solomon? Is it related to the Reed-Solomon erasure code? [[zk-STARK]]
[[https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/fri#intuition-for-security][Anatomy of a STARK, Part 3: FRI]] states "Intuitively, a prover who lies in one location is hardly cheating, because it is a single error in an error-correcting code."
It seems we are filling the algebraic execution trace with redundant data (extending the row with \( \rho \)  ).
* What is the relationship between FRI and STARK? [[zk-STARK]] 
+ FRI: somewhat like a polynomial commitment scheme.
+ STARK: a zero knowledge way to prove things.
* What is the use of coset in FRI? [[zk-STARK]] 
[[https://aszepieniec.github.io/stark-anatomy/fri.html#coset-fri][Anatomy of a STARK, Part 3: FRI | Anatomy of a STARK]] states "The STARK protocol is also defined in terms of Reed-Solomon codewords."
