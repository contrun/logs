3.2.11. Fall-back keys. Most of the key types described so far have an
extra 32-bit integer field in their TL description, normally equal to zero.
However, if the key obtained by hashing that description cannot be retrieved
from or updated in the TON DHT, the value in this field is increased, and a new attempt is made. In this way, one cannot "capture" and "censor "a key (i.e., perform a key retention attack) by creating a lot of abstract addresses lying near the key under attack and controlling the corresponding DHT nodes.
