However, if the key obtained by hashing that description cannot be retrieved
from or updated in the TON DHT, the value in this field is increased, and a new attempt is made. In this way, one cannot "capture" and "censor "a key (i.e., perform a key retention attack) by creating a lot of abstract addresses lying near the key under attack and controlling the corresponding DHT nodes.
