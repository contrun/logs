* How to reduce a classification problem into a regression problem? [[machine learning]]
The difference between 2-classification problem and regression problem is that the range of 2-classification (say \( \{1, 2\} \) problem is discrete. We can use sigmoid function to smoothen the function from features to the category of the classification. And then use regression techniques to solve this problme.
For a multiclass classification problem, say we have \( n \) categories, we can reduce this classification to a \( n \) regression problem. Each of the these regression functions take value \( 1 \) on one category and \( 0 \) on all other categories. There are \( n \) regression functions in total. These functions give a rough probability of whether this sample belong to the corresponding category (every value greater than 0.5 means belonging). We can take maxium of these sigmoid outputs. For mutually exclusive classification task, Softmax function is more appropirate.
