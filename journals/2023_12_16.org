* How to reduce a classification problem into a regression problem? [[machine learning]]
The difference between 2-classification problem and regression problem is that the range of 2-classification (say \( \{1, 2\} \) problem is discrete. We can use sigmoid function to smoothen the function from features to the category of the classification. And then use regression techniques to solve this problme.
For a multiclass classification problem, say we have \( n \) categories, we can reduce this classification to a \( n \) regression problem. Each of the this regressions
