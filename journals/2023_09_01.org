* Does semantic security imply that the length is preserved under encryption, i.e. messages with the same length are encrypted into messages with the same length? [[A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography]]
Yes, because otherwise we can differentiate two messages by the length of their ciphertext. This must be hold as nested encryption are semantically secure.
