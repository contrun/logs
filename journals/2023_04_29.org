* How can we avoid the confirmation bias described in Assume You know? It seems to be human's instinct to confirm his theory when asked an open-end question (like the one given in the book, we want to confirm that what the author described is Kennedy). [[Start with Why]]
* Way to manipulate people to buy some products. [[Start with Why]]
** Price
*** price plummet makes people buy things they don't really need
*** another example given in [[Predictably Irrational]] is that people buy a comparatively better choice (like digital and paper-version of The Economist bundle in $9.9 vs only the paper version in $9.9)
*** the cost of free is highest (see [[Predictably Irrational]] )
** Promotions
*** breakage, rebate or coupons that can't be fulfilled (e.g. having pre-conditions like you can use the coupon only if you have spent more than $1000, you can use only one in one purchase)
*** bundles that have so many things that are not needed
** Fear
*** FUD
** Aspirations
Fear/Aspiration are two sides of the same coin. It works by take advantage of one's infirmity. Ironically, FUD works better. It is far easier to cohort people into something than persuade people into something.
