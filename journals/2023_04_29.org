* How can we avoid the confirmation bias described in Assume You know? It seems to be human's instinct to confirm his theory when asked an open-end question (like the one given in the book, we want to confirm that what the author described is Kennedy). [[Start with Why]]
* Way to manipulate people to buy some products. [[Start with Why]]
** Price
*** price plummet makes people buy things they don't really need
*** another example given in [[Predictably Irrational]] is that people buy a comparatively better choice (like digital and paper-version of The Economist bundle in $9.9 vs only the paper version in $9.9)
*** the cost of free is highest (see [[Predictably Irrational]] )
** Promotions
*** breakage, rebate or coupons that can't be fulfilled (e.g. having pre-conditions like you can use the coupon only if you have spent more than $1000, you can use only one in one purchase)
*** bundles that have so many things that are not needed
** Fear
*** FUD
** Aspirations
Fear/Aspiration are two sides of the same coin. It works by take advantage of one's infirmity. Ironically, FUD works better. It is far easier to cohort people into something than persuade people into something. It is always hard to make people commit to something.
** Peer Pressure
** Innovation
** Monopoly
** Any other effective ways for a small company to manipulate people to buy their products?
* In marketing, what is the best order for a merchant to persuade the consumer to buy their products? Is it why -> how -> what or why -> what -> how? Making how we do it the last of the persuasion seems to be a norm. This makes the merchant more credible when the manufacturing of something requires quite some efforts. [[Start with Why]]
* Do we need to ask why WHY (that is, raison d'etre is reasonable and can find it niche) to make sure we are in the right direction? Do we also need some market research? [[Start with Why]]
* Why is WHY so important? Is it because the competition so fierce that we need something to stand out? [[Start with Why]]
* We are easier to be persuaded when we are given some opinions (Why does the manufacturer do it) than when we are given facts (what does the manufacturer have). It seems facts make use more rational instead opinions. Are we fundamentally feeling-based instead of thinking-based? [[Start with Why]]
* It seems to me that I always make decisions based on some deciding factors instead weigh out all the things, e.g. I chose to order one hotel because it provides gym but the gym facilities are almost unused for me. [[Start with Why]]
* The most powerful way to make people buy your products is to give them a sense of belongingness. That is, the products are made for them. All people like they are buying the same products (all the cool kids in the school use macbooks). [[Start with Why]]
