* Ways to create labels
+ hand labeling
+ weak supervision with label functions (giving many potentially inaccurate ways to label dataset, and combine these functions)
+ semi supervision (assume that the labels of the whole dataset can be learned from a small subset)
+ transfer learning
+ active learning (based on the uncertainty of a model to some data or disagreeness of serveral models to some data, send the data to annotator to manually label them)
