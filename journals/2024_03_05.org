* How do we know the ~funding_pubkey~ before ~open_channel~ in lightning network? [[lightning network]]
[bolts/02-peer-protocol.md at master Â· lightning/bolts](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md#the-accept_channel-message)
The field ~funding_pubkey~ in the message ~open_channel~ is the public key in the 2-of-2 multisig script of the funding transaction output. The thing is that we need to communicate with each other so that we know the public key of the receiver? How does the sender know this? By node advertisement?
