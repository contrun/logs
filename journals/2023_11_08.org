A pseudorandom bytestream excludes identification techniques based 
on pattern matching, and makes it easier to shape the bytestream in 
order to mimic other protocols used on the Internet. This raises the 
cost of a connection censoring firewall, forcing them to either resort 
to a full MitM attack, or operate on a more obvious allowlist basis, 
rather than a blocklist basis.
