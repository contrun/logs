* Early return from the execution of an embedded language.
There are two ways to early return from the execution of an embedded language.
+ driven by external signals.
+ triggered by the running of a custom language function like ~early_return(code)~.
The first may require the embedded language runtime having some kind of hook mechanism. The second requires non-local jump mechanism like exception throwing and catching.
