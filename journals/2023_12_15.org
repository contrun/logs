Say that a field F has a few alternative values (f_1, f_2, f_3), we normally encode this field by create fields like has_field_1, has_field_2 (has_field_3 is ignored as it can be inferred from has_field_1 and has_field_2), the value of has_field_1 and has_field_2 are 1 or 0 to signify the existence of f_1 and f_2. This method is also called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot][One-hot encoding].
