* Is proofs that can be checked by oracle models a strict superset of proofs that can be checked by interactive models? Give some examples that show oracle models are more powerful. [[theoretical computer science]] 
In oracle models the verifier issues queries to the oracle machine (the prover should submit related information to the oracle machine, and the oracle machine responds to the verifier accordingly), while in interactive models the verifier directly challenge the prover. It seems oracle models are strictly more powerful as the oracle machine may act as a message relayer. Anything can be done by interactive models has a counterpart in the oracle model.
