* What is in a pretrained model file (e.g. ImageNet models, large language models)? Why can we fine tune this model file to new datasets? [[machine learning]] [[fine-tuning]]

When we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the fine_tune method fastai does two things:

    Trains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen
    Unfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested
