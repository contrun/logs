* Formally define the duality of generative approach (e.g. context free gramma) and recognition approach (e.g. automaton) of formal languages. Prove that the expression power of regular expression and automation are equivalent.
* Why cant't regular expression have nested structure? Why there is no regular expression for language of parenthesized expressions? Is the context free gramma a strict superset
*
