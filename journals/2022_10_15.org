* Formally define the duality of generative approach (e.g. context free gramma) and recognition approach (e.g. automaton) of formal languages. Prove that the expression power of regular expression and automaton are equivalent. [[compiling techniques]]
* Why can't regular expression have nested structures? Why there is no regular expression for language of parenthesized expressions? Is the languages that can be represented by context free gramma a strict superset of the languages that can be represented by regular expression? The answer seems to be yes by divide and conquer every cases. What are the languages that can not be represented by regular expression but can be represented by context free gramma. Nested structure is an example. Any more examples? [[compiling techniques]]
