As of this writing, the most recent versions of the design add two outputs to the commitment transaction—one for each LN party—and require all other outputs in the commitment transaction to have their scripts encumbered by a ~1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY~ (CSV) condition that prevents them from being spent for at least one block.
