* How to efficiently implement ~file(1)~? It seems to be a problem of Backtrack and
Branch+Bound. How to parallelize this? [[algorithms]] [[parallel computing]]
* How to recover public key from EcDSA signature? Why does the recover process does not always work? [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]]
Given a Elliptic curve in the finite field or with generator \( G \) of order \( n \). We sign the message \( z \) by the private key \( a \) as follows. Generate a random scalar \( k \), calculate the coordinates
