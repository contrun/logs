* How to efficiently implement ~file(1)~? It seems to be a problem of Backtrack and
Branch+Bound. How to parallelize this? [[algorithms]] [[parallel computing]]
* How to recover public key from EcDSA signature? Why does the recover process does not always work? [[Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm]]
Given a Elliptic curve in the finite field of characteristics \( p \) with generator \( G \) of order \( n \). We sign the message \( z \) (assumed \( z \in \mathbb{Z}_n \), otherwise hashing it to the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_n \)) by the private key \( a \) as follows.
** Signature generation
Generate a random scalar \( k \), calculate the coordinates \( (x, y) = k G \), let \( r = x mod n \), \( s = k^{-1}(z + ra) \).
** Signature verification
