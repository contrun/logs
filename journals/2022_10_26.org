* Notarization/origin verification/TPM signing for code in the public? [[development practices]] 
There are a few use cases that are similar to some extent.
+ Some platforms (e.g. macOS) require notarization for software to be distributed on its platform by a developer certificate issued by the platform owner. This certificate should never be put to the public.
+ In some cases (e.g. keepassxc browser extension), the origin of a browser extension request must be verified before we can trust the request. We must not allow third party to fake extension identity.
+ Verified boot for linux is particularly ugly as we have so many Linux distributions. OEM does not know which keys to trust. They only trust microsoft's key by default.
