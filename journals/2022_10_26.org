* Notarization/origin verification/TPM signing for code in the public?
+ Some platforms (e.g. macOS) require notarization for software to be distributed on its platform by a developer certificate issued by the platform owner. This certificate should never be put to the public.
+ In some cases (e.g. keepassxc browser extesion), the origin of a browser extension request must be verified before we can trust the request.
