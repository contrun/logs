* What does [Memory coherence in shared virtual memory systems | ACM Transactions on Computer Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/75104.75105) teach us for cache coherence in distributed systems? [[memory coherence]] [[cache coherence]]
In shared virtual memory systems, keeping memory coherent is non-trivial (just like cache coherence in distributed systems). Is there any cache coherence lessons we can learn from this paper?
