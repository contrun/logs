* What property ensures the \( g = \sigma(f) \) in plonk paper P20?
Let \( a = g^n \)
* What is the meaning of polynomial permutation in constraint systems? What about extended permutation?
* Is the constraint system given in plonk paper p22 general enough to be Turing complete? What kind of circuits are general enough to be Turing complete? Give some sufficient and necessary conditions.
* How do we convert the execution of a program into a constraint system? How do we convert a constraint system to a polynomial commitment? How do we convert from a series of equations to one equation for verification in the constraint system?
