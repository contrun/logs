* Expressiveness of operation-based CRDT vs state-based CRDT. It seems that operations and states in CRDT are just like batch and stream in computation. Are the expressive power of these two equivalent? What about SQL statements like ~UPDATE table_name SET column_name = column_name + 1~ that both are operations and rely on current state?
