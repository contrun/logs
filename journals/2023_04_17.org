#+BEGIN_QUOTE
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a technique for 
dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the 
visualization of high-dimensional datasets. The technique can be 
implemented via Barnes-Hut approximations, allowing it to be applied on 
large real-world datasets.
