* A completely trivial example of semantically secure encryption scheme that is not pseudo-random ciphertext secure is given any sematically secure encryption scheme defined on \( (\mathcal{K}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{C}) \), we extend ciphertext space to \( \mathcal{C} \cup \mathcal{C}' \) where \( \mathcal{C}' \) is a set disjoint from \( \mathcal{C} \), and leave other things the same. This encryption scheme is obviously not pseudo-random ciphertext secure. Do we have any other semantically secure encryption scheme that is not pseudo-random ciphertext secure? In other word, restricting the ciphertext space to those ciphertext having non-empty preimage, is this semantically secure encryption scheme a psed
