* Can the operating system stop one program from running without waiting for the preemptive context switch, i.e. must the operating system wait for the time slice of this program to run out? [[further investigation needed]] [[system programming]]
* How can one thread (may be green threads) of a program stop other threads from running? Must we resort to operating system interfaces? Does the thread to be killed have a change to clean up?
