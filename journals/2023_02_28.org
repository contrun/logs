* Reducing memory-consistency-checking to multiset equality checking by padding each write/read operations with an corresponding read/write operation. [[zero knowledge proofs]] 
For each write operation, we precede it with a read operation which just discards the result. For each read operation, we follow it with a write operation that has the same value as the read result. More over, we record the initialization of the memory and scan the final memory.
