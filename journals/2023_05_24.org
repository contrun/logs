* How can [[https://github.com/nilfoundation/zkllvm][NilFoundation/zkllvm]] turn llir into verifiable computation? It seems other zero knowledge protocols can only turn programs into circuits by actually running the programs and obtain all the programs' states. zkLLVM has to deal with problems like determining if a program stops. This is in general not possible. [[zero knowledge proofs]] [[zkLLVM]]
