* What's the magnitude of circuit gates that a normal program has when compiled by ZK VM? [[zero knowledge virtual machines]]
* What's the use of representing identity permutations as degree-1 polynomials in plonk paper p26? Why must we add a multiplicative factor to the right and output elements? [[plonk]]
* How does revocation in GPG work? It the revocation certificate a special signature (like signing the message "THIS PUBLIC KEY IS LOST, DON'T USE IT ANY MORE", how do we avoid this payload collides with normal payload) created at an eariler time which is generally agreed that if it is published then anyone should not trust the public key anymore? [[further investigation needed]]
* How does key aggregation for Schnorr signature works? [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/068][Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin]]. Schnorr signature is not automatically homomorphic, i.e. let \( (pk_1, s_1, m_1) \) and \( (pk_2, s_2, m_2) \) be two valid signature, how can we construct a third signature \( (pk_3, s_3, m_3) \) (a sensible choice of \( pk_3 \) can be \( pk_1 + pk_2 \), and \( m_1, m_2, m_3 \) may be identical) which can be verified by normal Schnorr signature verification procedure.

* Why do we require Schnorr signature in [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki][bips/bip-0341.mediawiki at master · bitcoin/bips]]? [[Schnorr signature]] [[further investigation needed]]
* In [[https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki][bips/bip-0341.mediawiki at master · bitcoin/bips]], the output key \( P_2 \) (tweaked from internal key \( P \)) is obtained by setting \( P_2 = P + H(P \parallel h) \)G where \( G \) is the generator of the group? \( H \) is a cryptography hash function and \( h \) is the merkle tree root which has the script-path spending key as a leaf. Can an attacker fakes \( P^\prime, h^\prime \) which satisfies \( P_2 = P^\prime + H(P^\prime \parallel h^\prime)G \) so that \( h^\prime \) contains the a secret key that owned by the attacker? How do we prove the security of this? What assumptions does the security of this lies on? [[taproot]] [[further investigation needed]]
