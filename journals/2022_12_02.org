* How is protected virtual machine [[https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization][Android Virtualization Framework (AVF)]] isolated? Why can AVF guarantee that the guest's security and integrity despite of host being compromised. It must rely on technologies like [[AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization]]. What are they? [[Android Virtualization Framework]]
* Can the Android Virtualization Framework host read memory of a guest? [[Android Virtualization Framework]]
According to [[https://source.android.com/docs/core/virtualization/architecture][AVF architecture  |  Android Open Source Project]], pKVM is running in EL2 (more privileged than the the execution level of linux kernel, EL1), thus it is able to protect memory of pVM from the linux kernel. But the thing is that must pKVM implement all the page protection facilities itself? If so, isn't it too large for a trusted common base (T)
