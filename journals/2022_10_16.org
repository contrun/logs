* Prove the Grammar and Automaton relationship. Regular Grammar <-> Finite-State Automaton, Context-Free Grammar <-> Push-Down Automaton, Context-Sensitive Grammar <-> Turing Machine. [[compiling techniques]] [[6.035]]
Finite-State Automaton <-> Regular Grammar: regular grammar has three operations union, string concatenation and Kleene star. For every terminal symbols in the regular language, we construct a terminal state for the finite-state automaton, for Kleene stars, we construct a state which has a transition from it to itself, for string concatenation, we construct a state from the prefix to the postfix with the last character as transition letter.
* Number-theoretic transform vs discrete Fourier transform? [[algorithms]] [[further investigation needed]]
The NTT is a generalization of the classic DFT to finite fields. Does NTF only change the multiplication and addtion? Since we can do Fourier transform on a group. It seems that we only need to change addition.
