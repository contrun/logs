* A cheaper way to transfer assets for exchanges and its users.
Let \( ex \) be a exchange (say bitcoin exchange) with users \( A \) and \( B \), \( C \) be a bitcoin user who has not deposited bitcoins in \( ex \), \( T \) be the Merkle tree in which \( ex \) stores the users and balances information. The following logic is implemented in a public-auditable contract. Users should check the integrity of the contract first before using the contract.
+ Deposit
Say \( A \) want to deposit a balance of \( x \) to the \( ex \). \( A \) communicates with \( ex \) on a off-chain channel.
+ Transfer
+ Withdraw
