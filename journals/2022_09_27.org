* Network encapsulation protocols (e.g. geneva) vs overlay networks. Are geneva etc only intended for data center? What do they do to make them better suited for data center? Including more Enterprise-grade TM features like multi-tenancy?
* Why is it even possible to implement a userspace rcu library? [[http://liburcu.org/][Userspace RCU]]
* Why is sparse merkle tree (SMT) a key-value store? What's the type of key and value of this store? What do the nodes in the tree store? What are membership and non-membership proofs in SMT concretely? How do we obtain non-membership proofs? [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/683][Efficient Sparse Merkle Trees: Caching Strategies and Secure (Non-)Membership Proofs]]
* How to calculate the Schnorr signature of a message? Why is it homomorpic, i.e. let sig1 = sign(pk1, message), sig2 = sign(pk2, message), then (sig1+sig2) is a valid signature (pk1 + pk2) to the message. How useful is it in real world?
* Why does taproot need Schnorr signature?
* What to do when the operands of vector instructions are not aligned?
* Why does llvm needs a tablegen ([[https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/][TableGen Overview â€” LLVM 16.0.0git documentation]])? What does tablegen do? How to obtain the results of tablegen? How to use them in llvm?
