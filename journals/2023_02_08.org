Such encoding functions, in which the vector a is a subset of its encoding LDE(a) are called systematic. The systematic nature of the low-degree extension encoding turns out to render it more useful in the context of interactive proofs and arguments than the Reed-Solomon encoding of Section 2.3 (see, for example, Section 10.3.2).
