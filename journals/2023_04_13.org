* How to detect function return in riscv binaries? In [[https://gist.github.com/contrun/bd634088ac03d37ee93835131a765c89][this example]], ~_start~ calls ~main~ which in turn calls ~test_func~. The thing is that ~main~ directly ~j~ to ~test_func~ without changing the link. This way, although semantically ~test_func~ returns to ~main~ which in turn returns to ~_start~. But in execution, it seems that ~test_func~ directly returns to ~_start~. [[riscv]] [[system programming]]
